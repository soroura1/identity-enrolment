# `identity-enrolment`

**The enrolment broker and tenancy directory. Turns an external platform's user into a facility seat.**

**Depends on:** `contracts`
**Part of:** Citadel — see the plan in `citadel-planning/`

## Scope boundary — read this first

> Citadel is for **preparedness, exercise and improvement only**. It is explicitly **not**:
>
> - live incident command or live incident operations
> - live triage or patient tracking during a real event
> - clinical decision support
> - facility certification or accreditation
>
> If a request would move the product across that line — a "use during a real incident" mode, a
> live patient board, anything that could be mistaken for clinical guidance — **stop and raise it
> rather than building it.**

**This statement is reproduced verbatim in every repository and on every entry surface.** It is a
safety property of the product, not a scoping preference, and it is not negotiable by a feature
request, a pilot, a customer, or a deadline.
